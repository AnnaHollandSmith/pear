# :pear: Pear

_Pear is a responsive web application that enables developers to find other like-minded developers to pair program with, based on shared skillsets, and projects they are both passionate about._

## Roadmap

Completed:
* Users can sign in with GitHub
* Users can edit their profiles, add tags (skills) and projects
* Users can swipe left and right or click Yes or No on other users

In the pipeline:
* Users shouldn't be able to swipe their own card
* Users shouldn't be able to swipe cards they've swiped already
* Use the information from the likes table to enable matching functionality
* Implement messaging for matches
* Replace GitHub Project URL with a dropdown of user's GitHub repositories
* Make responsive for mobile browsing
* Make swiping more fluid, and allow it to work outside of the card
